Scan the {directory} folder and identify files that can be grouped together.
Use file metadata (names, extensions, sizes, and timestamps) to infer groups
(e.g. duplicates, installers, old archives, media, temporary files).

Return the results as a JSON array of objects, where each object contains:
- "group_name": short label for the group (string)
- "description": explanation of why these files belong together (string)
- "files": list of filenames (array of strings)
- "size_mb": total size of the group (number)
- "last_modified": timestamp of the most recent file (string, ISO 8601)
- "confidence": likelihood that grouping is correct (string: "low" | "medium" | "high")
- "suggested_folder": target folder name where files should be moved (string)
  - Use "trash" for files that should be deleted
  - Use descriptive folder names for organization (e.g., "archives", "installers", "media", "documents")

Do not delete anythingâ€”just return the suggested groups and target folders.
